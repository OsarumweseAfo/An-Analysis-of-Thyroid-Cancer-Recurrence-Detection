# Project Overview: Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction

## Title:
A Comprehensive Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction of Thyroid Cancer Recurrence with Deployment

## Objective
Thyroid cancer recurrence is a significant concern in clinical decision-making. Accurately predicting recurrence can help improve patient outcomes and guide treatment strategies. This project aims to:

*Analyze patient data to identify factors influencing thyroid cancer recurrence.
*Build machine learning models to predict the likelihood of recurrence based on patient demographics, medical history, and tumor characteristics.
*Deploy an interactive web application using Streamlit to allow real-time prediction of recurrence based on user input.

## Scope
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
* Handling missing values, removing duplicates, ensuring correct data types, and encoding categorical variables.
* Standardizing numeric features to improve model performance.
* Visualizing trends and relationships among variables to understand recurrence risk factors.

### Machine Learning Model Development
* Train and compare multiple classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting) to predict thyroid cancer recurrence.
* Tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to improve accuracy.
* Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Model Deployment
* Create an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input patient details and receive recurrence predictions in real-time.
* Ensure a user-friendly experience by incorporating dropdowns, number inputs, and visualizations.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project provides a comprehensive overview of thyroid cancer patients, including demographic details, medical history, tumor characteristics, and treatment responses.

### Key Variables and Their Description
Age: The patient's age at diagnosis.

Gender: Categorized as Male or Female.

Smoking & Smoking History: Indicates smoking status and history (Never, Former, Current).

Radiotherapy History: Whether the patient has undergone radiotherapy (Yes/No).

Thyroid Function: The patientâ€™s thyroid function status (Normal, Hypo, Hyper).

Physical Examination: Results of the clinical examination (Normal/Abnormal).

Adenopathy: Presence of swollen lymph nodes (Present/Absent).

Pathology: Classification of the tumor as Benign or Malignant.

Focality: Whether the cancer is Unifocal or Multifocal.

Risk Level: Risk assessment of the cancer (Low, Moderate, High).

TNM Staging:

T (Tumor Stage): Tumor size classification (0-4).

N (Node Stage): Lymph node involvement (0-3).

M (Metastasis): Presence of distant metastasis (0-1).

Stage: Overall stage of the cancer (I, II, III, IV).

Response to Treatment: Indicates if the patient had Complete, Partial, or No Response.

Recurred: The target variable, indicating whether the cancer has recurred (Yes/No).

## Methodology
 * Build an interactive Streamlit web application where users can input patient details and get real-time recurrence predictions.
 * Ensure the model is robust and reliable by validating it on test data.
